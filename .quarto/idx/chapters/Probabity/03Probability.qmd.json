{"title":"Probability","markdown":{"headingText":"Probability","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWe saw that the probability of an event $A$, denoted as $P(A)$, is a number between 0 and 1, where:\n\n- $P(A) = 0$ indicates that the event $A$ is impossible.\n- $P(A) = 1$ indicates that the event $A$ is certain to occur.\n- $0 < P(A) < 1$ indicates that the event $A$ has some probability between impossible and certain.\n\n## Probability of a Conjunction of Two Events\n\nThe probability of the conjunction (intersection) of two independent events $A$ and $B$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$ \\text{Probability} (A \\text{ and } B) = \\text{Probability} (A) \\times \\text{Probability} (B) $$\n\nThis formula assumes that events $A$ and $B$ are independent, meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other.\n\n**Example: six-sided die**\n\nIf you want to find the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die (Event $A$) **and** flipping heads on a fair coin (Event $B$), and both events are independent, you would first find the individual probabilities of each event:\n\n- Probability of rolling a 3 on a six-sided die: $P(A) = \\frac{1}{6}$ (1 favorable outcome out of 6 possible outcomes)\n- Probability of flipping heads on a fair coin: $P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}$ (1 favorable outcome out of 2 possible outcomes)\n\nThen, you can calculate the probability of the conjunction of these events:\n\n$$ \\text{Probability} (A \\text{ and } B) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12} $$\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die and flipping heads on a fair coin is $\\frac{1}{12}$ or approximately 0.0833 when both events are independent.\n\n## Probability of a Union of Two Events\n\nThe probability of the union of two events $A$ and $B$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$ \\text{Probability} (A \\text{ or } B) = \\text{Probability} (A) + \\text{Probability} (B) - \\text{Probability} (A \\text{ and } B) $$\n\nThis formula calculates the probability of either event $A$ or event $B$ occurring, taking into account the possibility that both events could occur simultaneously. The term $\\text{Probability} (A \\text{ and } B)$ represents the probability of the intersection (conjunction) of events $A$ and $B$.\n\nIf events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur at the same time), meaning $\\text{Probability} (A \\text{ and } B) = 0$, the formula simplifies to:\n\n$$ \\text{Probability} (A \\text{ or } B) = \\text{Probability} (A) + \\text{Probability} (B) $$\n\n**Example: six-sided die**\n\nFor example, if you want to find the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die (Event $A$) or flipping heads on a fair coin (Event $B$), and these events are mutually exclusive, and $P(A) = \\frac{1}{6}$ and $P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}$, the probability of the union of these events would be:\n\n$$ \\text{Probability} (A \\text{ or } B) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die or flipping heads on a fair coin (assuming they are mutually exclusive events) is $\\frac{2}{3}$ or approximately 0.6667.\n\n\n\n## Conditional Probability\n\nConditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted by $P(A | B)$, which reads as \"the probability of event $A$ given event $B$.\" The formula for conditional probability is:\n\n$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(B)} $$\n\nwhere:\n- $P(A | B)$ is the conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$.\n- $P(A \\text{ and } B)$ is the joint probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring.\n- $P(B)$ is the probability of event $B$ occurring.\n\nIn words, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is the ratio of the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occurring to the probability that $B$ occurs.\n\n### Examples of Conditional Probability\n\n**Example 1: Medical Test Accuracy**\n\nConsider a medical test for a disease, where the test result can be positive ($+$) or negative ($-$). Let:\n\n- $D$: Person has the disease.\n- $T$: Test result is positive.\n\nThe conditional probability here is $P(D | T)$, the probability that a person has the disease given that the test result is positive. The accuracy of the test can be represented as follows:\n\n- The probability of a true positive: $P(T | D) = 0.95$ (the test correctly identifies 95% of those with the disease).\n- The probability of a false positive: $P(T | \\neg D) = 0.10$ (the test incorrectly indicates positive for 10% of those without the disease).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, $P(D | T)$ can be calculated considering both true positives and false positives, making it a key application of conditional probability in real-life scenarios.\n\n**Example 2: Weather Forecast**\n\nConsider two weather events:\n\n- $S$: It will be sunny tomorrow.\n- $R$: It will rain tomorrow.\n\nLet's say meteorologists have found that:\n\n- The probability of a sunny day given that it rained today is $P(S | R) = 0.20$.\n- The probability of a rainy day given that it was sunny today is $P(R | S) = 0.15$.\n\nThese probabilities represent how weather conditions are interrelated. For instance, $P(S | R) = 0.20$ means that there is a 20% chance of a sunny day tomorrow if it rains today. These conditional probabilities are crucial for weather forecasting, helping meteorologists make predictions based on current weather conditions.\n\n\n**Example 2: Six-Sided Die**\n\nConsider the experiment of rolling a fair six-sided die. Let's define two events:\n\n- $A$: The outcome is an even number $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$.\n- $B$: The outcome is greater than 3 $\\{4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\nWe want to find $P(A | B)$, which represents the probability that the outcome is an even number given that it is greater than 3.\n\nFirst, let's find $P(A \\cap B)$, the probability that the outcome is both an even number and greater than 3. The outcomes in the intersection of $A$ and $B$ are $\\{4, 6\\}$, so:\n\n$$ P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nNext, let's find $P(B)$, the probability that the outcome is greater than 3. There are 3 outcomes in $B$, so:\n\n$$ P(B) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability:\n\n$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\nSo, the probability that the outcome is an even number given that it is greater than 3 ($P(A | B)$) is $\\frac{2}{3}$ or approximately $0.6667$.\n\n\n## Independence in Probability\n\nTwo events, $A$ and $B$, are considered **independent** if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. In other words, $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if:\n\n$$ P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) $$\n\nIn this case, the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring individually.\n\nAlternatively, events $A$ and $B$ are independent if either of the following conditions (equivalent statements) holds:\n\n1. $P(A | B) = P(A)$ (the probability of $A$ given $B$ is the same as the probability of $A$).\n2. $P(B | A) = P(B)$ (the probability of $B$ given $A$ is the same as the probability of $B$).\n\nIf events $A$ and $B$ are independent, knowing whether $A$ occurs or not provides no information about the occurrence of $B$, and vice versa.\n\nIndependence is a fundamental concept in probability theory and plays a crucial role in various applications, including statistics, engineering, and decision-making processes. It allows for simpler calculations and modeling of complex systems by assuming that certain events do not influence each other.\n\n### Examples of Independence in Probability\n\n**Example 1: Coin Toss and Dice Roll**\n\nConsider the events:\n\n- $A$: Tossing a fair coin and getting heads.\n- $B$: Rolling a fair six-sided die and getting a 4.\n\nThe outcome of the coin toss does not affect the outcome of the die roll, and vice versa. The probability of getting heads on the coin ($P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$) and the probability of rolling a 4 on the die ($P(B) = \\frac{1}{6}$) are independent events. The joint probability $P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n**Example 2: Drawing Cards**\n\nConsider a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Let:\n\n- $C$: Drawing a spade from the deck.\n- $D$: Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) from the deck.\n\nThe event of drawing a spade ($P(C) = \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}$) is independent of the event of drawing a face card ($P(D) = \\frac{12}{52} = \\frac{3}{13}$). The joint probability $P(C \\text{ and } D) = P(C) \\times P(D) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{13} = \\frac{3}{52}$.\n\n**Example 3: Weather Events**\n\nConsider two weather events:\n\n- $S$: It will be sunny tomorrow.\n- $R$: It will rain tomorrow.\n\nIf the occurrence of rain tomorrow does not influence the probability of it being sunny tomorrow (and vice versa), events $S$ and $R$ are independent. For instance, if $P(S) = 0.7$ (70% chance of sun) and $P(R) = 0.3$ (30% chance of rain), these events are independent if $P(S \\text{ and } R) = P(S) \\times P(R) = 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21$.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"03Probability.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
